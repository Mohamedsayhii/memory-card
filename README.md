# Memory Card Game

This project is a memory card game developed using React. The game imports images from an API, and players aim to select unique images without repeating any selection. The game tracks two scores: the current score and the highest score. If the player selects the same image twice, the game is lost. The project uses React's state and effect hooks to manage the game logic, and Sass is used for styling.
